/**
 * Represents a product.
 * Requirement: Defines a Product model ( name, price, id, optional category or description).
 *
 * Have taken that to imply that the optional category or description should not be used together.
 * I'm assuming that this is a partial implementation of a product model, and that additional
 * requirements such as stock management, images, etc. will be added later.
 *
 * @property id Unique identifier for the product (no assumption made wrt SKU).
 * @property name Display name of the product.
 * @property price Current price of the product in EUR.
 * @property category Optional category details for the product.
 * @property productDescription Optional detailed description of the product.
